## Summary

I combine an engineering mindset with product thinking. I started as a **software engineer**, automating calculations and processes at industrial facilities. Later, I transitioned into **product analytics and management** — developing MVPs, segmenting audiences, and building hypotheses and metrics.  
Currently, I manage an e-commerce store and develop projects from scratch: from assortment and marketing to unit economics and strategy.

> My goal is to grow products where decisions are driven by data and hypotheses are tested quickly and clearly.
